- 👋 Hi, I’m @ialbertmartinez
- 👀 I’m interested in creating semantic and functional websites that are:
  - responsive: built to withstand any viewport you throw at it
  - accessible: Deliver, as best i can, the same rich user experience regardless of how you surf the web
  - user-friendly: made for humans by an actual human being, me.
- 🌱 Web languages, libraries, and frameworks I have learned: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Native, Redux, jQuery, node, ruby, CLI, SQL, MySQL, MongoDB.
- 🎓 Attending the Software Engineering Program @ #TripleTen (formerly Practicum)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects
